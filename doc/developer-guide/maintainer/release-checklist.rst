Release checklist (maintainer reference)
=========================================

You are a eventyay maintainer and want to release a new version? Hold on to your fancy hat or your favourite socks, here we go!

Boarding checks
---------------

1. Are the translation files up to date?
2. Are there pending checks for bad translations on Weblate?
3. Are there pending translations from `Weblate <https://translate.Eventyay.com/projects/eventyay/eventyay/#repository>`_? Merge them.
4. Are all locales with more than 75% coverage included in the release?
5. Update the translation percentages from `translate.Eventyay.com <https://translate.Eventyay.com/projects/eventyay/eventyay/#translations>`_.
6. If new translations were added, add new calendar locales (you have to download the `release archive <https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/releases/download/v6.1.5/fullcalendar-6.1.5.zip>`_) and extract the locales from there), and make sure that flags (in input fields) for the new locale are shown.
7. Are there warnings about missing migrations?
8. Any blockers to see `in our issues <https://github.com/fossasia/eventyay/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22type%3A+bug%22+>`_?
9. Are there any TODOs that you have to resolve?
10. Are there any ``@pytest.mark.xfail`` that you have to resolve?
11. Is the GitHub release description well-phrased and complete?
12. Are there `open pull requests <https://github.com/fossasia/eventyay/pulls>`_ that you should merge?
13. Are all tests passing in CI?
